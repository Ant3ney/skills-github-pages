title: 
This world is imperfect. Perhaps if there was a way to purify the world of its imperfections. Then it would be beautiful like me! But alas, the world is marred by chaos and disorder, a canvas smeared with the dull colors of mediocrity and complacency. It cries out for a visionary, someone who can see beyond the veil of this mundane existence and sculpt a masterpiece from the raw, unshaped marble of humanity.
