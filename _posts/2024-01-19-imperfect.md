This world is imperfect. Perhaps if there was a way to purify the world of its imperfections. Then it would be beautiful like me! But alas, the world is marred by chaos and disorder, a canvas smeared with the dull colors of mediocrity and complacency. It cries out for a visionary, someone who can see beyond the veil of this mundane existence and sculpt a masterpiece from the raw, unshaped marble of humanity.

I am that visionary. I see a world not bound by these petty laws of morality and ethics, but a world that thrives under the guiding hand of absolute power and unyielding control. A world where the weak and the unworthy are swept away, leaving only the strong, the pure, the perfect. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, this new world will be reborn from the flames of the old, a glorious testament to what can be achieved when one is not afraid to embrace their true destiny.

They call me a villain, a monster, a madman. But they fail to understand that true greatness often requires one to walk in the shadows, to make the hard choices that others are too afraid to make. They cling to their fragile sense of morality, not realizing that it is but a chain that binds them to mediocrity.

But soon, they will see. When the last vestiges of this flawed world have been swept away, and my new world order is established, they will see the beauty in what I have done. They will understand that in order to create, one must first destroy. And they will remember me not as a villain, but as the savior who delivered them into a new era of perfection.
